/* The Frustrated Artist's Character Head Challenge

Create a function named drawCharacterHead that receives 
skillLevel, features, difficulties, and mood as its parameters.

The function simulates an artist's attempt to draw a character's head, 
incorporating the artist's skill level, the difficulty of drawing each feature, and the character's mood.

The function should use advanced logical operators to determine the 
success of drawing each feature, create a string representation of the drawn head using advanced 
string concatenation, and sort the artist's thoughts using an advanced sorting algorithm.

Parameters:
- skillLevel (int): The artist's skill level, ranging from 1 to 10.
- features (String[]): An array of facial features (e.g., "eyes", "nose", "mouth", "ears", "hair").
- difficulties (int[]): An array representing the difficulty of drawing each feature, ranging from 1 to 10. This array corresponds to the features array.
- mood (String): The character's mood (e.g., "happy", "sad", "angry").

The function returns a String array containing two elements:
- A string representation of the drawn character's head.
- A sorted string array of the artist's thoughts.

Follow these rules to implement the function:
- Use the logical operator && to determine if a feature is successfully drawn: 
(skillLevel >= difficulties[i]) && (Math.random() < 0.7).
- For each successfully drawn feature, add a detailed description to the head representation. 
- For failed attempts, add a basic placeholder.
- Generate thoughts for the artist based on the drawing process (e.g., "The eyes are challenging!" for a difficult feature).
- Sort the artist's thoughts alphabetically, ignoring case. If two thoughts start with the same letter, 
sort them based on their length in descending order.
- Incorporate the character's mood into the final head representation.

Note: Since we can't use random functions in the actual implementation, 
replace Math.random() with a deterministic alternative in your solution.

Create a function named createFlavorMatrix that receives mainIngredients and seasonings as its parameters.

Your task is to create a culinary flavor matrix by combining main ingredients with various seasonings. This matrix will represent unique flavor combinations, simulating a culinary experiment in the kitchen.
The function should create and return a 2D array where each element is a combination of a main ingredient and a seasoning. Follow these steps:

Create a 2D string array with dimensions: number of main ingredients × number of seasonings.
Use nested loops to iterate through both input arrays.
For each combination, concatenate the main ingredient with the seasoning, separated by a space and a plus sign.
Store each combination in the corresponding cell of the 2D array.

Parameters:
- mainIngredients (String[]): An array of strings representing the main ingredients.
- seasonings (String[]): An array of strings representing the seasonings.

The function returns a 2D string array (String[][]) representing the flavor matrix.
